# GDB Documentation for Clown Language

This documentation explains how to use GDB (GNU Debugger) to debug programs written in Clown Language, a custom scripting language designed for simplicity and functionality.

## Prerequisites

- **GDB**: Ensure you have GDB installed. You can install it via your package manager.
- **Clown Language Compiler**: Compile your Clown scripts with debug information enabled. Use the `-g` flag when compiling to include necessary debug data.

## Compiling with Debug Information

When compiling your Clown scripts, use the following command to generate debug information:

```bash
clownc -g your_script.clown -o your_program
```

## Running GDB

To start debugging with GDB, use the following command:

```bash
gdb ./your_program
```

### Basic GDB Commands

Once inside GDB, you can use the following commands to navigate and debug your program:

- **Run the Program**:
  ```gdb
  run
  ```

- **Set Breakpoints**:
  You can set breakpoints at specific lines or function calls:
  ```gdb
  break <line_number>
  break <function_name>
  ```

- **Continue Execution**:
  After hitting a breakpoint, continue execution with:
  ```gdb
  continue
  ```

- **Step Through Code**:
  To step through your code line by line, use:
  ```gdb
  step
  ```

- **Inspect Variables**:
  Check the value of variables using:
  ```gdb
  print <variable_name>
  ```

- **View Call Stack**:
  To see the current call stack, use:
  ```gdb
  backtrace
  ```

- **Quit GDB**:
  To exit GDB, simply type:
  ```gdb
  quit
  ```

## Debugging Clown Language Constructs

### Working with Variables

You can inspect and modify variables defined in your Clown scripts. For example, if you have a variable `text`, you can view its content:

```gdb
print text
```

### Debugging Functions

When debugging functions like `update` or `sum`, set breakpoints within the function definitions to check how they execute:

```gdb
break update
```

### Exception Handling

In Clown Language, you may use `try` and `catch` constructs. To observe error handling in action, set breakpoints within your `catch` blocks:

```gdb
break <line_number_of_catch>
```

### Working with Objects

If you have defined objects (like `@car` or `@house`), you can inspect their attributes:

```gdb
print @car.model
print @house.@garage
```

### Using GDB Scripts

To automate your debugging sessions, consider writing GDB scripts. You can create a script named `gdb_commands.gdb`:

```gdb
break main
run
backtrace
```

Run this script with:

```bash
gdb -x gdb_commands.gdb ./your_program
```

## Conclusion

By following this documentation, you should be able to effectively debug programs written in the Clown Language using GDB. Remember to compile your scripts with debug information and familiarize yourself with basic GDB commands to navigate your code efficiently.
