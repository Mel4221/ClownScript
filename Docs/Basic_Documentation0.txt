# Documentation for Clown Language

## Overview
Clown Language is a high-level programming language designed to support functional programming styles and scripting similar to Bash. It aims to provide a flexible syntax for various programming paradigms, including object-oriented and asynchronous programming.

## Getting Started
To begin using Clown Language, include the necessary scripts and define your namespaces:

```clown
include "scripts"
include "http://clownapps.com/clownshell/scripts.clown"
include "/usr/update dtf/str_dnf/a b c d/lastest/test.clown"

namespace "updater"
```

## Basic Syntax
Clown Language supports various styles, including functional and scripting syntax. Functions are defined with an arrow (`->`) and can return values.

### Example
```clown
int sum -> int a, int b
    int x = a + b
return x
```

## Namespaces
Namespaces are defined using the `namespace` keyword, allowing for organized code and avoiding naming conflicts.

## Variables and Data Types
Variables can be defined using the `@` symbol for references or `$` for mutable variables. Basic data types include `int`, `string`, and custom objects.

### Example
```clown
@person.user_name = "mel"
@person.user_email = "mel@gmail.com"
```

## Functions and Methods
Functions can be defined with parameters and return types. Methods within objects are also defined using the same syntax.

### Example
```clown
@animal
[
    name = ""
    lastName = ""
    int age = 0
    speak -> 
        print "animal makes a sound"
    return void
]
```

## Error Handling
Error handling uses `try` and `catch` blocks to manage exceptions gracefully.

### Example
```clown
try update -> 
catch @error -> 
    print $"{@error.message
    there has been an error while trying to process the update
    please try to check your internet connection or the server}"
```

## Control Structures
Conditional statements and loops are available for flow control.

### Example
```clown
if @result.number == 1 -> @error
```

## Objects and Classes
Objects are defined using the `@` symbol and can have properties and methods. Inheritance is supported.

### Example
```clown
@dog -> @animal
[
    bark -> 
        speak
        print "Dog Barking"
    return void
]
```

## Arrays and Collections
Arrays can be defined using square brackets, and methods like `.add` and `.clear` are available for manipulating collections.

### Example
```clown
@fruits = ["Orange", "Blueberry", "Apple", "Banana"]
print @fruits.length
@fruits.add "Pineapple"
print @fruits.length
```

## Pointers
The language supports pointer manipulation, allowing for dynamic data structures and memory management.

### Example
```clown
@car* = []
@house
[
    @add
]
@house.add @car
```

## Asynchronous Operations
Asynchronous programming is facilitated using the `async` keyword for non-blocking operations.

### Example
```clown
async -> update_sys
```

## Examples
### Update Function
A function to manage updates with error handling:

```clown
update_sys ->
    $update = $"{$temp/update/sys.update}"
    @result = wget "http://www.github.com/user/updates.clown" -o "{$shell_temp/update.clown}"
    if @result.number == 1 -> @error
    ...
return void
```

### Summation Function
A simple function to sum a list of numbers:

```clown
sum -> @list
    var total
    foreach item in @list ->
        total += item
return total
```
