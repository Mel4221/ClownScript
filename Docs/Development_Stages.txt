Yes, you’re correct! In the development of a programming language, the parser is typically one of the first components you need to implement. Here’s a brief overview of the stages involved and the role of the parser:

### Stages of Language Development

1. **Lexer (Lexical Analysis)**:
   - This component breaks the source code into tokens (keywords, identifiers, symbols, etc.). It reads the input text and generates a stream of tokens for the parser.

2. **Parser (Syntax Analysis)**:
   - The parser takes the tokens generated by the lexer and analyzes them according to the grammar of your language. It constructs a parse tree (or abstract syntax tree, AST) that represents the hierarchical structure of the code.
   - At this stage, you can also perform syntax checking and report errors if the code doesn’t conform to the defined grammar.

3. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - After parsing, this stage checks for semantic errors, such as type checking and scope resolution. You might also build a symbol table here to keep track of variable declarations and their types.

4. **Intermediate Representation (IR)**:
   - You can convert the AST into an intermediate representation, which may simplify further processing (like optimization and code generation).

5. **Code Generation**:
   - In this stage, you generate the target code (e.g., machine code, bytecode, or another intermediate form) from the IR.

6. **Debug Information Generation**:
   - Once you have the parsed and analyzed code, you can also generate debug information (like DWARF) at this point. This should include metadata about variables, functions, and line numbers.

### Summary

- **Implement the Parser Early**: The parser is fundamental because it establishes how the source code is structured. It allows you to create the AST, which is critical for further stages, including semantic analysis and code generation.
- **Integrate Debug Information**: Once you have the AST and semantic checks in place, you can generate the necessary debug information alongside the compiled code.
